                        Merciful</i></b> <br>
                <b style="color: #FF073A;">Who is Israel ?!</b><br>
                <b style="color: #FF073A;">Allah says in the Holy Quran:</b> <i style="color: #39FF14;">The Jews are a
                    cursed people and are described as cowards.</i><br>
                These people are so cowardly that they only have the strength to oppress innocent civilians, children,
                women, and the elderly.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they have heinously murdered the prophets sent to them.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they place their own people in key positions worldwide, using
                money and blackmail to manipulate and control.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they sell, use, or sacrifice their own children for money and
                property.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they view women as worthless objects, property, or slaves.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they begin to oppress anyone they consider weaker, threatening
                their property and lives.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they attack one person with a hundred others. In war, they
                disregard any rules of ethics, even killing animals out of treachery and dishonor.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they act like timid individuals, only willing to take extreme
                measures when their own lives or property are at risk.<br>
                They are so cowardly and treacherous that they do not hesitate to use media, television, and social
                networks to incite discord and unrest in all nations.<br>
                <b style="color: #FF073A;">These people are cursed by Allah.</b> <i style="color: #39FF14;">They are
                    dishonorable and shameless people without a homeland. They will be disgraceful until the Day of
                    Judgment.</i><br>
                No matter where you go in the world, if there is a problem, it is likely that they are involved. They
                are like bloodsuckers, involved in usury, bribery, immorality, money laundering, gambling, and more.
                While committing genocide in front of the world's eyes, they create an illusion of justification. From
                cowards, everything can be expected; the actions of cowards are unpredictable, and true bravery is not
                seen in them. They are despicable, worthless people. <b style="color: #FF073A;">We will drown you in
                    your own blood and choke you with our saliva.</b>
